\description{
Scoring of Drugs via Network-based Methods
}
\details{
This is th wrapper function for the two proposed methods for
personalized scoring of drugs for individual cancer samples via network-based
methods. The available methods are 'distance-based' and 'RWR'. For the
'distance-based' method, the score between a gene (g) and drug (d) is formulated
as:
\deqn{score(g, d) = driver(g) / (d(g, d) + 1)^2}
where driver(g) is the driverness probability of gene g, as predicted by
'driveR' and d(g, d) is the distance withing the PIN between gene g and drug d.
The final score of the drug d is then the average of the scores between each
altered gene and d:
\deqn{score(d) = \Sigma{score(g, d)} / |genes|}

For the 'RWR' method, a random-walk with restart framework is used to propagate
the driverness probabilities.

By default \code{\link{DGIdb_interactions_df}} is used as the
\code{drug_interactions_df}.

If the \code{W_mat} argument is not supplied, the built-in STRNG data
\code{\link{STRING_adj_df}} is used to generate \code{W_mat}.
