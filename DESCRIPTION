Description: Identification of the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for each 
    patient based on genomic alterations is a major challenge in personalized 
    oncology. 'PANACEA' is a collection of personalized anti-cancer drug 
    prioritization approaches utilizing network methods. The methods utilize 
    personalized "driverness" scores from 'driveR' to rank drugs, mapping these
    onto a protein-protein interaction network. The "distance-based" method 
    scores each drug based on these scores and distances between drugs and genes
    to rank given drugs. The "RWR" method propagates these scores via a 
    random-walk with restart framework to rank the drugs. The methods are 
    described in detail in Ulgen E, Ozisik O, Sezerman OU. 2023. PANACEA: 
    network-based methods for pharmacotherapy prioritization in personalized 
    oncology. Bioinformatics <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btad022>.
