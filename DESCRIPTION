Description: Identification of the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for each 
    patient based on genomic events is a major challenge in personalized 
    oncology. 'PANACEA' is a collection of personalized anti-cancer drug 
    prioritization approaches utilizing network methods. The methods utilize 
    personalized "driverness" scores from 'driveR' to rank drugs, mapping these
    onto a protein-protein interaction network. The "distance-based" method 
    scores each drug based on these scores an distances between drugs and genes
    to rank given drugs. The "RWR" method propagates these scores via a 
    random-walk with restart framework to rank the drugs.
