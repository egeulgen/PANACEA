Identification of the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for each patient based on genomic events is a major challenge in personalized oncology. `PANACEA` is a collection of personalized anti-cancer drug prioritization approaches utilizing network methods. The methods utilize personalized "driverness" scores from [`driveR`](https://github.com/egeulgen/driveR) to rank drugs, mapping these onto a protein-protein interaction network. The "distance-based" method scores each drug based on these scores an distances between drugs and genes to rank given drugs. The "RWR" method propagates these scores via a random-walk with restart framework to rank the drugs.

## Installation

You can install the development version of PANACEA from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("egeulgen/PANACEA")
```
